# gazorpafy

Gazorpafy is a spotify vue app, that allows premium users to listen to their music from spotify.

The app was made with Vue.js for the frontend app, and Spotify API gave most of the code for the authorization flow 
which is handled with node.js in the server side part of the app.
All the data used is retrieved from the Spotify web API.
The app uses the Spotify Web Playback SDK.
Most inspiration for the design was taken from the desktop app and was handled with node-scss.
Icons and fonts are from Google Fonts and Google Icons.

Feel free to contact me for any feedbacks and improvements.

Enjoy :)

P.S. This repository is only for the frontend part, the app won't work since it needs a backend
server to work. Contact me for more info on that :)
